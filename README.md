# Projects

## Survival Analysis: Midodrine Use and ED Transfer
**Tools:** R  
**Methods:** Survival analysis, time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models

This project examines the association between midodrine use and time to transfer from the emergency department using a retrospective cohort design. A time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was implemented to appropriately handle delayed drug administration during follow-up.

After adjustment for clinical covariates, midodrine use was not significantly associated with transfer time, while several vital signs and clinical indicators were found to be important predictors. This project demonstrates advanced survival analysis techniques and handling of time-varying exposures in R.

## Outcomes Research Analysis of Cardiac Surgery Patients
**Tools:** SAS

**Methods:** Data management, descriptive statistics, PROC FREQ/TABULATE/MEANS, inferential testing

This project presents an outcomes research analysis based on simulated cardiac surgery data, completed using SAS. The analysis involved cleaning and merging multiple clinical datasets, reconstructing time-varying age at each event date, and identifying same-day surgical procedure combinations using BY-group processing and retained counters.

Key deliverables included publication-ready demographic tables, summaries of surgical procedure combinations, and mortality analyses stratified by race and smoking history. Smoking status was found to be significantly associated with younger age at death, supported by both descriptive summaries and inferential testing.

The project demonstrates SAS proficiency, including robust data preparation, quality control, results reporting, and clear interpretation suitable for presentation to clinical investigators.
