## Outcomes Research Analysis of Cardiac Surgery Patients
**Tools:** SAS
**Methods:** Data management, descriptive statistics, PROC FREQ/TABULATE/MEANS, inferential testing

This project presents an outcomes research analysis based on simulated cardiac surgery data, completed using SAS. The analysis involved cleaning and merging multiple clinical datasets, reconstructing time-varying age at each event date, and identifying same-day surgical procedure combinations using BY-group processing and retained counters.

Key deliverables included publication-ready demographic tables, summaries of surgical procedure combinations, and mortality analyses stratified by race and smoking history. Smoking status was found to be significantly associated with younger age at death, supported by both descriptive summaries and inferential testing.

The project demonstrates SAS proficiency, including robust data preparation, quality control, results reporting, and clear interpretation suitable for presentation to clinical investigators.
